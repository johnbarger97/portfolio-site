      <p><b>The Challenge:</b> Get user feedback and improve the player experience of my game, “Hold My Hand”.</p>

      <h2>“Hold My Hand” - A Mobile Game</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The game, “Hold My Hand” is an endless runner mobile game that I started with a friend during a game jam. The theme of the game jam was “Stronger Together”. Our idea was an endless runner where you maneuver two players through obstacles. What makes them stronger together, is that they can hold hands to jump higher.</p>

      <p>After a preliminary version of the game was completed during the jam, I decided to spend an extra two weeks adding polish and fine tuning the gameplay.</p>

      <p>Three weeks after starting this journey, "Hold My Hand" was complete. It is now fun to play and I am proud of the finished product.</p>

      <p>It took a lot of iterations to get to this point. In this case study, I will talk about the evolution of “Hold My Hand” and how I used qualitative user feedback to get it to where it is now.</p>

      <h2>Control Scheme Iterations</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Through the process of play testing and creating a smooth player interaction experience, the control scheme of this game went through several iterations.</p>

      <h3>First Control Scheme</h3>
      <p>My very first requirement when designing a control scheme was that it needed to be simple. Many mobile games don’t use more than one finger and I wanted my game to have the same convenient appeal.</p>
      <p>Here is the first control scheme:</p>

      <p></p>
      <img style="height: 350px; object-fit: cover;" src="assets/hmh-project/control_scheme1.gif" alt="">
      <ul>
        <li>Swipe down to toggle link. (hold hands)</li>
        <li>Swipe up to jump. (Both Players)</li>
        <li>Tap to toggle players to the outer / inner lane.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Out of all the control schemes, this one was the best when it came to usability on account of its simplicity. It was intuitive and easy to learn, but it quickly became clear that this control scheme limited the number of possible position combinations. I immediately recognized that maximizing the variety of positions would lead to a more fun experience, so I set out to do just that.</p>

      <p>To maximize position combinations, I wanted to move towards a control scheme that allowed for individual control over the two players.</p>

      <h3>Second Control Scheme</h3>

      <p>After recognizing that individual player control was important, I began working on a new control scheme. Although this control scheme would have to use two fingers, I wanted the controls to remain simple. </p>

      <p>Here is my solution to this problem:</p>
      <img style="height: 350px; object-fit: cover;"src="assets/hmh-project/control_scheme2.gif" alt="">

      <ul>
        <li>Keep two fingers on the screen to control each player.</li>
        <li>The players follow each finger at the corresponding sides of the screen.</li>
        <li>Move your finger up to jump the corresponding player.</li>
        <li>Keep one finger on the screen to control linked players.</li>
        <li>The linked players follow your single finger.</li>
        <li>Move that finger up to jump.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After I was happy with the implementation of these controls, it was time for play testing. I had friends and family try the game. They had fun with it. It was also easy to learn, but I still noticed some usability issues while people played:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fingers were crammed on the screen. In order to get players close to each other the user had to almost touch their fingers together. (I fixed this by remapping finger positions, but it didn’t matter because of the second issue.)</li>
        <li>Keeping your finger on the screen while swiping up to jump felt bad. Users wanted to lift their fingers from the screen (resulting in unintended movement) and the instant feedback of a quick motion (like a swipe) wasn’t there.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>I tried to fix the problems with this mechanic by remapping finger positions to keep them from bumping each other, but ultimately I couldn’t fix the jump issue so it was time for another control scheme.</p>
      <h3>Final Control Scheme</h3>

      <p>After having explored a few iterations, I had a lot of qualitative data from previous playtesting to come up with a good control scheme. Here’s my final solution:</p>

      <img style="height: 350px; object-fit: cover; background: black;"src="assets/hmh-project/control_scheme3.gif" alt="">

      <ul>
        <li>Control the players using either side of the screen: swipe left / right to move, and up to jump.</li>
        <li>Swipe Down anywhere to link</li>
        <li>Control linked players by using any part of the screen: swipe left / right to move, and up to jump.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At an early stage of developing these controls, you had to tap either side of the screen to move players (toggle their position). I corrected the control scheme after playtesting when I discovered that players were confused by combining taps and swipes.</p>

      <p>Soon after, I had a successful round of playtesting and the control scheme was finalized.</p>


      <h2>Clear Communication at a Low Resolution</h2>

      <h3>Tutorial Instructions</h3>

      <p>Creating good tutorial instructions was another challenge at such a low resolution. I was limited to only a few words and symbols. My approach for creating the tutorial was to think about the most important information and what details could be left to inference. The resulting instructions were clear and concise without cluttering the UI.</p>

      <p>I also added a "reccommended grip" screen to the beggining of the tutorial. During playtesting I noticed people having a hard time settling into a comforable grip while learning the game.</p>

      <h2>Other UX Improvements</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Players that use reading glasses and have a harder time seeing things up close, struggled to differentiate between different obstacles. There wasn’t a good way to make obstacles extra clear with the art direction and graphics of the game. This was a stylistic oversight, but I didn’t want to ignore the problem. To make the experience more enjoyable for them I added an “Easy Visibility” option in the settings.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Getting feedback from a variety of users helped to perfect the control scheme, increase clarity in the UI, and improve the overall user experience. The time that I spent talking with the people that played my game was definitely worth it and I’m happy with the final product. </p>

      <p>After playtesting with friends and family the game is ready to ship, and I’m ready for a higher volume of user feedback.</p>
