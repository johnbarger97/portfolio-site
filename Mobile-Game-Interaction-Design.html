      <h2>“Hold My Hand” - A Mobile Game</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The game, “Hold My Hand” is an endless runner mobile game that I started with a friend during a game jam. The theme of the game jam was “Stronger Together”. Our idea was an endless runner where you maneuver two players through obstacles. What makes them stronger together is that they can hold hands to jump higher.</p>

      <p>After a preliminary version of the game was completed during the jam, I decided to spend an extra two weeks adding polish and fine tuning the gameplay.</p>

      <p>Three weeks after starting this journey, "Hold My Hand" was complete. It is now fun to play and I am proud of the finished product.</p>

      <p>It took a lot of iterations to get to this point. In this case study, I will talk about the evolution of “Hold My Hand” and how I used qualitative user feedback to get it to where it is now.</p>

      <h2>Control Scheme Iterations</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Through the process of play testing and creating a smooth player interaction experience, the control scheme of this game went through several iterations.</p>

      <h3>First Control Scheme</h3>
      <p>My very first requirement when designing a control scheme was that it needed to be simple. Many mobile games don’t use more than one finger and I wanted my game to have the same convenient appeal.</p>
      <p>Here is the first control scheme:</p>

      <p></p>
      <img style="height: 350px; object-fit: cover;" src="assets/hmh-project/control_scheme1.gif" alt="">
      <ul>
        <li>Swipe down to toggle link. (hold hands)</li>
        <li>Swipe up to jump. (Both Players)</li>
        <li>Tap to toggle players to the outer / inner lane.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Out of all the control schemes, this one was the best when it came to usability on account of its simplicity. It was intuitive and easy to learn, but it quickly became clear that it limited the number of possible player positions. I immediately recognized that giving the player more movement options would lead to a more fun experience, so I set out to do just that.</p>

      <h3>Second Control Scheme</h3>

      <p>I wanted to improve the control scheme by allowing individual player movement. This would require the use two fingers, so I would need to be creative in order to keep the controls simple.</p>

      <p>Here is my solution to this problem:</p>
      <img style="height: 350px; object-fit: cover;"src="assets/hmh-project/control_scheme2.gif" alt="">

      <ul>
        <li>Keep two fingers on the screen to control each player.</li>
        <li>The players follow each finger at the corresponding sides of the screen.</li>
        <li>Move your finger up to jump the corresponding player.</li>
        <li>Keep one finger on the screen to control linked players.</li>
        <li>The linked players follow your single finger.</li>
        <li>Move that finger up to jump.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After I was happy with the implementation of these controls, it was time for play testing. I had friends and family try my game. They had fun with it. It was also easy to learn, but I still noticed some usability issues while people played:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fingers were crammed on the screen: In order to get players close to each other the user had to almost touch their fingers together.</li>
        <li>Keeping your finger on the screen while swiping up to jump simply felt bad. Users wanted to lift their fingers from the screen (resulting in unintended movement) and it lacked the instant feedback of a quick motion (like a normal swipe)</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>I fixed the finger cramming problem by remapping finger positions, but ultimately I couldn’t fix the jump issue, so I had to look at new solutions.</p>
      <h3>Final Control Scheme</h3>

      <p>After having explored a few iterations, I had plenty of qualitative data from previous playtesting to come up with a good control scheme. Here’s my final solution:</p>

      <img style="height: 350px; object-fit: cover; background: black;"src="assets/hmh-project/control_scheme3.gif" alt="">

      <ul>
        <li>Control the players using either side of the screen: swipe left / right to move, and up to jump.</li>
        <li>Swipe down anywhere to link.</li>
        <li>Control linked players by using any part of the screen: swipe left / right to move, and up to jump.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At an early stage of developing these controls, you had to tap either side of the screen to move players (toggle their position). I discovered that players were confused by combining taps and swipes so I tranformed it into the full swipe system that you see in the final game.</p>

      <p>Soon after, I had a successful round of playtesting and the control scheme was finalized.</p>


      <h2>Clear Communication at a Low Resolution</h2>

      <p>"Hold My Hand" uses an 8bit style and has a very low resolution. These stylistic constraints made clear communication within the UI quite a challenge.</p>

      <h3>Tutorial Instructions</h3>

      <p>Creating good tutorial instructions was a challenge at such a low resolution. I was limited to only a few words and symbols. My approach for creating the tutorial was to think about the minimum information necessary and what details could be left to inference. The resulting instructions were clear and concise without cluttering the UI.</p>

      <p>During playtesting I noticed people were having a hard time settling into a comforable grip while learning the game. To address this, I added a "recommended grip" screen to the beggining of the tutorial. </p>

      <h2>Other UX Improvements</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Players that use reading glasses and have a harder time seeing things up close struggled to identify obstacles. There wasn’t a good solution that made obstacles extra clear and conformed to the art direction and graphics of the game. This was a stylistic oversight, but I didn’t want to ignore the problem. To make the experience more enjoyable for them I added an “Easy Visibility” option in the settings menu.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Getting feedback from a variety of users helped to perfect the control scheme, increase clarity in the UI, and improve the overall user experience. The time that I spent talking with the people that played my game was definitely worth it and I’m happy with the final product. </p>

      <p>After playtesting with friends and family the game is ready to ship, and I’m ready for a higher volume of user feedback.</p>
