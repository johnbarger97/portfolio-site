        WA.business was a non-profit group that I started with an associate from college. The goal of the project was to support small businesses during the pandemic. Unfortunatly, we were undable to continue due to lack of funding, but we still learned a lot while trying our best to kickstart this project.

        Here is the landing page for WA.business. I created the graphics and UI, while my associate focused on copywriting.
