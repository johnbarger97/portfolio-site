      <p>This logo was made to evoke the feeling of a Broadway Theater while feeling modern and simple. It was made completely with original typography using a custom font created for this client called Modern Theater. The font uses double stroked lines which are iconic of Broadway Typography. The lines are also simple and geometric for a more modern feel. The ticket stub icon was crafted to complement the original letter forms.</p>
