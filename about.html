				<p>
					I'm a web developer with a passion for building empathy-driven tools. I've always been attracted to the overlap between form and function and love finding creative solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I learned about design while earning my associates degree in graphic technologies. During this time I did as many real world design projects as I could get my hands on. I learned all about branding and had a lot of fun creating logos and custom typefaces for different local businesses. It was during school that I also spent much of my freetime learning web development.
				</p>
				<p>
					After college, me and a friend from school decided to take on a large freelance project together. The project was a communications overhaul for an organization in which he worked on Branding and I worked on Web Design. This project was when I realized that connecting with the user and creating a product that empathized with them is something that I love doing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since realizing that User Experience is what fascinates me above all, I've been wanting to pursue a career in UX.
